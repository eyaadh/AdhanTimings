# AdhanTimings

This is my first attempt in creating a simple iOS Application to present Adan Timings for Maldives from a pre-recorded JSON Data sets. Nothing fancy done in the project also in addition to prayer timings it also contains a list of Duas/Zikrs you can go through.

To run the project, simply clone the project and Open via XCode. The whole Build was done on XCode 13.3, MacOS Monterey and tested on 13 Pro Max.
